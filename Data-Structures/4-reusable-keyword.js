// Object Oriented Programming: Make Code More Reusable with the this Keyword:

// The last challenge introduced a method to the duck object. It used duck.name dot notation to access the value for the name property within the return statement:

// sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + duck.name + ".";}

// While this is a valid way to access the object's property, there is a pitfall here. If the variable name changes, any code referencing the original name would need to be updated as well. In a short object definition, it isn't a problem, but if an object has many references to its properties there is a greater chance for error.

// A way to avoid these issues is with the this keyword:

let dog = {
    name: "Spot",
    numLegs: 4,
    sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + this.numLegs + " legs.";}
  };
  
  dog.sayLegs();
